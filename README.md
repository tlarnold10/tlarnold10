Live in Lester, IA (town of 200 just outside of Sioux Falls, SD)

Enjoy spending time with my 2 daughters and lifting weights. 

## Quirks
- Sarcastic
- Will curse from time to time
- Very passionate about ownership and will bring it up fairly often
- I am a religious person, but won't talk about it unless you feel comfortable
- I listen to heavy metal, rap, classical, pop, and Christian music... I know, it makes no sense
- Big fan of Jocko Willnk who is a Navy seal and very intense
- Can get visably annoyed or heated from time to time
    - wear my emotions on my sleeve
- Patience is certainly a weakness of mine
- Move fairly quickly and need to slow down and look at the details from time to time

## Leadership Style
- I always had __ownership__, __focus__, and __expectations__ written on my whiteboard, so I'll tend to focus and talk about these things a lot
- Hard conversations don't get better with time, if you need to talk about something that is not going to be fun, talk about it sooner rather than later.
    - If you are struggling with something, please talk to me about it.
- I want you to be successful on this team
- Going to push people to get better, sometimes outside of their comfort zone
- I don't like to micromanage, but will do it if someone is struggling
- I trust you to get your work done in the time allocated (the sprint), I don't want to have to watch the clock for when you are in and out of the office. 
- We are all grownups and I expect people to complete their work on a schedule that fits them best
- I want people to be open and honest. However, people should have awareness that their is a time and a place for certain conversations
